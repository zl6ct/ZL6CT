What motivates you to contribute to open source?

There are not enough votes for this article, so the statistics may not be convincing, but I think the author has listed most of the reasons.
One point of the article that interests me is that the motivation is often not a single factor, and that participating in open source projects can be beneficial in many ways.
Altruism also be a resaon, but more people are doing open source projects for fun, which I think is the most important factor.Contributors can have more freedom in choosing open source projects
The open source system, undoubtedly, promoting the development of the computer industry as people dare to release their immature work earlier,Which encourages a lot of positive interaction between apprentice programmers.In general, open source software is a mechanism by which programmers, for their own benefit, actually create tangible benefits for the programmer community itself.
