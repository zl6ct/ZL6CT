I tried OAuth and sails separately, at first I thought it was very easy to understand, but then I realized the benefits of OAuth.

The Sails is really easy to set up and start with new app. It is easy to understand by watching the example video.

But after I finish the Sails, I considered the OAuth. Last semester, I created a website which includes a log in page. In that website I just use the database to store the username and password. But I realized that it is not safe when I read this article.
If the web can realize the SSO, it could be much convinent, so I start trying with OAuth.
