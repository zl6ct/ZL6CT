# license
After reading the article, I learn that We have different licenses for open source projects, each with its own characteristics. I decided to use the MIT License for my open source project. Because MIT license gives software licenses more power and fewer restrictions.I can get more freedom to work with software. Besides that, it is free, which could be more suitable as a tentative choice.
