## For Web sso
I did this website before and I realized that I can add the SSO for this after learning this course.
As we know, SSO is a way to enable authorized applications to obtain user information. My website was a "Take a taxi website" like Uber. I want to use this function to let the driver 
get some information from the passenger but can't get their privacy. So I decided to use the Oauth to achieve this.
