# Zoom Session
I attended the zoom meeting April 7 at 11am: General CHAOSS Weekly Call and I palned to join the Risk Working Group.


## Podcast Reflection
  I am so glad to hear that you don't really need a PHD to do something. There should be no direct relationship between the degree and the participation in the project. The value of open source projects is participation.
  
 Software risk has always been a very important issue, but the problem is that it is too big to start with one view point. I am so glad that we can have a metric and  A detailed classification of them. In this way, we can have a basic cognization for this.
 
 As for me, I've only worked on real projects with smaller teams. And the tool is Unity, which also has a platform like github which could share the uploaded files. But comparing this ,I realized there was a big difference between the two and believed it would give me a different experience.
