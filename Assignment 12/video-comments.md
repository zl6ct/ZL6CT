How to keep users alive has been the most important feature of open source projects,because only a large number of long-term active users can keep open source projects up to date.
The evolution group inspired me a lot by using metrics to evaluate inactive users.For example, by analyzing open source projects before they were active, Their contribution to the length of the code,
 the analysis of their behavior.Although the analysis of big data lacks accuracy, it can also reflect some problems of AUGUR on the whole, so as to facilitate future adjustment.
 However, I have another suggestion. Besides the assessment of big data, some random surveys are also very important, because big data can also make mistakes.All in all, 
 I learned a lot about scientific evaluation during this conversation and it was intersting to hear the conversation.
