## Course Policies

### Participation, out-of-class exercises and in-class quizzes
Mastery of these topics is achieved through execution of the software engineering process. The course material and exercise sequences are designed to build a foundation upon which to successfully participate in a team-oriented software engineering project.

**There will be periodic short quizzes in this course**.  These will be announced in class during the session before each quiz. It is expected that you are current on your lecture notes, readings and assignments from the week prior to each quiz. There will be no more than five quizzes throughout the semester. If you are not present for a quiz you will not get credit.

Each exercise and lecture topic builds upon the concepts and lessons of the previous days and weeks, and therefore they are each critical to the progression of the class. The solution to each exercise will be provided and/or discussed after its due date. For this reason, **no late Exercises will be accepted**. All exercises are designed and intended to be an individual effort, _collaborative implementation or copying_ will result in a zero (0) on the exercise for all students involved. During lecture times, participation exercises and quizzes will be administered. These serve two purposes: to gauge the comprehension of the class regarding the recent lecture topics and concepts, and to survey lecture participation. **These participation events cannot be made up when missed, resulting in a zero (0) grade.**

### Exceptions due to outside factors
Exceptions will be made to the above policies for only the following conditions: a) illness that is documented by a medical professional; b) pre-absence email notification to the instructor regarding illness, family related matters, career related matters. **WARNING:** information technology related problems/failures/challenges are not appropriate excuses for late work. As a student in a senior-level Computer Science course, it is expected that you are capable of mitigating the risks associated with technology!

## Self Determination as a Learner

**Learning** is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and some machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is not compulsory; it is contextual. It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by what we already know. **To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.** Learning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are relatively permanent.

_As a learner (aka student) in a senior-level Computer Science course,_ _ **it is expected that you are capable of problem solving, Internet-based research, and constructing your own creative solutions** _ _to problems presented by the course. You must be a motivated, self-sufficient learner; applying your own creativity and problem solving skills to the work assigned as part of this class. The teaching assistants assigned to the course are strictly available to help you work through conceptual learning of the course material, not resolve your technology challenges or simply tell you the answers. It is imperative that you engage your mind and thought processes during your work in this course, else-wise you are depriving yourself the opportunity to grow as a learner._

## Graduate Student / Credit (CS 7320)
Students taking Software Engineering for graduate credit (CS 7320) will complete all the same work as the undergraduate students.  Additionally, graduate students will be assigned further reading assignments related to position papers and emerging research in the field of Software Engineering. You will compose papers (or presentations) that are either multi-article compare and contrast reviews or single article critiques. These writings will be counted as part of the 35% course grade that is allocated to _Writing Assignments_. Furthermore, graduate students will complete extra design and development related to the semester group project.

## Academic Dishonesty
- _Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. 
- All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. 
- The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. 
- Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. 
- When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor._

## ADA Notice
_Students with Disabilities:_
 - _If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of this course, if you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need to make arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please let me know as soon as possible._
 - _If disability related accommodations are necessary (for example, a note taker, extended time on exams, captioning), please register with the Disability Center [http://disabilitycenter.missouri.edu](http://disabilitycenter.missouri.edu/), S5 Memorial Union, 573-882-4696, and then notify me of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. For other MU resources for persons with disabilities, click on Disability Resources on the MU homepage._

## Intellectual Pluralism
 - _The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may contact 
  - the Departmental Chair or Divisional Director; 
  - the Director of the_ Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities _(http://osrr.missouri.edu/); 
  - or the_ MU Equity Office _(http://equity.missouri.edu/), 
  - or by email at equity@missouri.edu. 
  - All students will have the opportunity to submit an anonymous evaluation of the instructor(s) at the end of the course._

## Recording Course Activities
 - _University of Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and Regulations._ _ **In this class, students are not allowed to make audio or video recordings of course activity unless specifically granted permission by Dr. Goggins** __. However, the redistribution of audio or video recordings of statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of the faculty member and of any students who are recorded. Students found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters._
