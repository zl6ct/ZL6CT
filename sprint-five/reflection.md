For now, I just follow the instruction on github to build an app which can sign in and sign out.It is easy to follow the instruction, but it is a little bit different because I use the windows OS which need to use git bash.There are also differences in the instructions. Like when I "virtualenv --python=python3 ../virtualenvs/dex" For my git bash , I need to add python -m before.

At the mean time, I still try to add the sso for my last Assignment's website. It still not work now, I will keep working on this, I think it is similar with this example, but I can't get ticket.

What I did

The SSO client sends a request to access the service resources provided by the application system. Get lt Sign in function and I have already got a database to store user information(by xmapp)

what I didn't finish

The SSO server should generate a random Service Ticket but I don't know how to achieve this.

functional description
I hope in the end of the semester I could add my website sign in connected with google account, which could be much easier. I hope the driver and the passenger (which I mentioned last Assignment) can get the information for each other without need their account password.
