# ZL6CT
For now, I just follow the instruction on github to build an app which can sign in and sign out. At the mean time, I still try to add the sso for my last Assignment's website. It still not work now, I will keep working on this, I think it is similar with this example, but I can't get ticket. 
What I did
The SSO client sends a request to access the service resources provided by the application system. Get lt
Sign in function and I have already got a database to store user information(by xmapp)
what I didn't finish
The SSO server should generate a random Service Ticket but I don't know how to achieve this.
