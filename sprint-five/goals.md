I want to build a taxi service system, similar to UBER or Lyft, that would bring another competitor to the market and drive competition. To have a successful business that involves not only vehicles but customers as well. Correctly identifying both driver and passenger is crucial for speediness of pickup times and to keep drivers on the road with passengers is the overall goal. The application could contain a large amount of data about current rides, giving admins the ability to see where more drivers are needed. Some information for Passenger and Driver will be collected(If allowed).
